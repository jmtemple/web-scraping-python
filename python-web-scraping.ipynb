    "# Introduction to Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is Beautiful Soup? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work\" ([Beautiful Soup Documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The library name is an allusion to the song Lewis Carroll character the Mock Turtle sings in Chapter 10 of *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Beautiful Soup` uses the structure of markup language documents (i.e. HTML, XML, etc) to extract information we can work with in a Python programming environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In this lab, we will be focusing on using `Beautiful Soup` to parse and scrape web pages built using HTML and CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installing Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We can install `Beautiful Soup` at the command line using a terminal or shell in our Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. To install `Beautiful Soup` using `pip`:\n",
    "- `pip install beautifulsoup4`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. For more on installing modules using `pip`: Fred Gibbs, \"Installing Python Modules with pip,\" The Programming Historian 2 (2013), https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0029.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. We also can install the `lxml` library to help with parsing HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. To install `lxml` using `pip`:\n",
    "- `pip install lxml`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loading URLs in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "11. We will be using the `requests` library to load URLs in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. This library is already built into Python and does not require additional installation.\n",
    "\n",
